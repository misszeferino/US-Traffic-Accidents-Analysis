The purpose of this project is to find out and visualize the data's main characteristics and trends using statistical methods and data visualization techniques.\n\n\n# Phase 1 Ask\n\n## About the data\n\nThe data can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers **49 states** of the USA. The accident data are collected **from February 2016 to Dec 2020**, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. Currently, there are about **1.5 million** accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.\n\n- It is important to notice that the dataset does not contain information about Alaska(AK) and Hawaï (HI).\n\n\n## Objective\n\nThe purpose of this analysis is to answer the following questions:\n\n - Which **States** and **Cities** have the most traffic accidents?\n - What is the **time of the day**, the **day of the wee**k and **the month** with the higher number of accidents?\n - How many accidents per **year**? And what is the trend, increasing or decreasing?\n - What are the most common weather conditions on the days of the accidents?\n - How many accidents have a severity level of 1, 2, 3 and 4?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Phase 2 Data Preparation\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing

Phase 5 Findings\n\n#### About the location\n- The dataset does not contain information about Alaska (AK) and Hawaï (HI).\n- California(CA) is the most populated state, followed by Texas(TX) and Florida(FL), they are also in the top 5 of the states with the higher number of accidents.\n- Oregon (OR) is the 3rd state with the most number of accidents and the 27th most populated state in the US.\n- Only 2,35 % of the cities have more than 1000 accidents \n- 1167 cities reported just 1 accident ( Need to investigate further)\n- The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially\n\n#### About the Timestamp\n- In the mornings, accidents start to increase at 5 am and reach a higher point at 8 am. \n- In the afternoon accidents start to increase at 13pm and reaches the higher point at 17pm\n- The number of accidents is lower on weekends\n- On weekends the distribution of accidents per hour is different than on weekdays. It increases at 12am and start to decrease at 1am\n- The number of accidents is higher in October, November and December. December is the mont with the most number of accidents. \n- It's important to noticed that the dataset starts in February 2016. The month of January 2016 is missing in this dataset.\n- 2020 has a significantly higher number of accidents. This is an issue that needs further investigation.\n\n#### About the Weather\n- Interestingly, most accidents happen on the days with a Fairweather, follow by days Mostly Cloudy.\n- Most accidents happen on days with temperatures between 50°F and 75°F (10°C and 23°C)\n\n#### About the Severity\n- Most accidents have a severity level of 2, 79.96% which means a lower impact on traffic. Level 4, high impact on traffic comes on third place with 7.5%.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Acknowledgements\nMoosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. **“A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.”**, 2019.\n\nMoosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Radu Teodorescu, and Rajiv Ramnath. **\"Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights.\"** In proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, ACM, 2019.","metadata":{}}]}
